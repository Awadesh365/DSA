merge sort:-
 The merge sort algorithm is based on a divide and conquer strategy.
Breaking down a list intoo several sub-list until sublist consist of a single
element and merging those sublist in a manner that results into a sorted list.

IDEA:-
 - Divide the unsorted list into N sublist, each containing 1 element
 - Take adjacent pairs of two singleton list and merge them to form a lsit of 2 elements. N will now convert into N/2 list of size 2.
 - Repeat the process till a single sorted list is obtained.

 The way this algorithm runs is
 1. Divide
 2. Solve by recursion (Conquer)
 3. Combine
