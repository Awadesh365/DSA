Selection sort:-
In this algorithm, we need two arrays here, the first solution is based on building the sorted array from scrach:
take the smallest, place it at the beginning of the new array, and remove it from the old array.
since we need to find the minimum element N times, the number of operations is
N+(N+1)+(N-2)+...+1 = (N*(N+1))/2 = O(n^2)

 Insersion sort:-
 IN this algorithm we will need only one array,
 for this algorithm we will always assume that the first i elements are sorted, and
 insert (i+1)th value in its correct place. it is important to note that this
 algorithm runs in O(n) time on already sorted arrays, but it up to O(n^2) for a reverse array.
 the number of swaps in actully equal to the number of inversions
 (pairs of elments i,j with i<j but a[i]>a[j]) in the original array.

/*
Bubble sort:-
The O(n^2)- timed sorting algorithm, the bubble sort is the one that behaves
the best on averege.
it initially assumes the array is sorted, then iterates over its elements searching for a pair of consecutive elemets that are inverted.
if it finds a pair, it swaps the elements and marks the array
as "NOT SORTED".
it continues to iterate over the array until a whole iteration goes without any swaps,
signaling that the array is sorted.
