Certain tasks show up often in rectangle geometry problems
-> Finding The overlapping area of two or more rectangles based on their
   coordinate points.
-> Determining whether two rectangles intersect.

NOTE-> Applicabale only to rectangles which have sides parallel to the coordinate axes.
  A rectangle can be represented with 2 points: its top right corner and bottom left corner.
  let top right corner be tr, and bottom left be bl.

  let coordinate of tr be (tr_x,tr_y), and coordinate of bl be (bl_x,bl_y)
