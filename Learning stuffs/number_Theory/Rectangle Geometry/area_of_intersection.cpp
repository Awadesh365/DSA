  since  any shape formed by the intersection of two rectangles is itself a rectange.
  if anyhow the shape becomes the square, so we know that square itself is a special kind of recangle.

  let us find the rectangl's length and width.
  width = min(tr_a_x,tr_b_x) - max(bl_a_x,bl_x)
  length = min(tr_a_y,tr_b_y) - max(bl_a_y,bl_b_y)

  if either of these values ar negative, the rectangle do not interset.
  if they are zero the rectangles intersect at a single point.
  multiply the length and width to find the overlapping area.
